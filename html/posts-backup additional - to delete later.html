			<h3>How to travel on a budget?</h3>

			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/hacks/2.jpg">

<h4>A few air tickets tricks for you!</h4>
<p>It’s no secret that we love a good deal, but this is especially true for travel. A new survey by Experian shows that the majority of vacationers spend more money than expected when traveling, so any savings we can drum up in advance is a great help. We’ve often heard that flying in and out of secondary airports can help you save, and everyone knows that Tuesday is the magic day to book, but what are other tried-and-true tricks are there? We dug deep to find the best insider hacks to turn that epic getaway you’re planning into an epic steal—read on.</p>
<h5>Timing</h5>
<p>Book at the right time. For domestic flights, 47 days out is considered the median best time to buy, while international travel varies by destination and should be purchased further in advance of your preferred departure date. If your dates are flexible, searching a +3/-3 (or 5/7) date range will yield a wide array of prices for you to consider.
Don’t book too early. So you know when and where you’re going—but don’t get overzealous! The average domestic fare found six months before a selected departure date was found to be 19% higher than fares searched for a month in advance.</p>
<h5>Itinerary</h5>
<p>Go multi-city. Once upon a time, a round-trip ticket into and out of the same city was the cheapest—only!—way to go. Not anymore. Sometimes, flying into one city and out of another will yield better prices.
Go one-way. Just as round-trip tickets into and out of the same city used to be the way to go, so too is the case for round-trip tickets in general. Two one-way tickets may in fact be cheaper than a full round-trip ticket, so don’t forget to check just to see.
Keep an open mind. In need of an escape but don’t care where to? Type “Everywhere” as your destination city on Skyscanner, and you’ll get a list of the cheapest flights all around the world. Who knows? You may stumble upon your dream getaway!
Consider stitching. If you’re not on a very tight travel crunch, building in a layover will almost always save you dollar bills. If you can make that layover functional (so, a half or full day!) and in a city you wouldn’t mind exploring, all the better. The trick is to not necessarily select a flight with a traditional layover, but instead to “stitch” separate tickets and flights together. So, a one-way to Paris followed by another one-way to Buenos Aires might be cheaper than a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires, with or without a stop.</p>
<h5>Check one-person flights first.</h5>
<p>Even if you’re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines hike up prices when you’re buying several seats at once.</p>
<h5>Tools</h5>
<p>Vary your search. Check aggregator sites such as Kayak, Orbitz, Skyscanner, and Airfarewatchdog as well as the individual websites of the airlines you are interested in; sometimes direct airline websites will have the best deals. Momondo.com pulls in every flight that exists, including lesser-known budget airlines, and usually has the cheapest flights (Kayak.com is a great tool, but it actually removed budget airlines from its search, so it doesn't always provide you with the widest range of options).
Use the right tools. Hopper, for example, analyzes flight prices daily and will notify you as prices drop. It also has a predictive feature built in. Hipmunk allows you to search date ranges to compare all of your options in one low-stress results page. Skyscanner is great if you’re deciding between a few different trips. You can compare prices for different trips and dates, and can also set alerts for particular routes and dates.
Trade your points. Points.com allows you to exchange, buy, and sell points from various loyalty programs. Trading or buying a few extra miles might be all you need to earn a travel reward.</p>
<h5>Secrets</h5>
<p>1.Clear your cookies.
 When searching for flights, clear your cookies or cache, or hop onto a different computer so that your browsing history doesn’t follow you. Peter Greenberg for Quartz tells us, “While there’s no proof or hard evidence, there is growing anecdotal evidence that suggests airlines are tracking your behavior online, and potentially even tracking IP addresses, and prices could go up for flights that are searched frequently.” While you’re at it, set your particular web browser to incognito or private browsing mode when shopping for fares. In Chrome or Safari, incognito is enabled by hitting Command (or Control, if using PC)+Shift+N. For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or Control, if using a PC)+Shift+P.</p>
<p>2.Use a fake point of sale.
International ticket prices, and especially domestic flights while in another country, can be cheaper depending on where you’re searching from. Follow these directions to adjust your point of sale and save. If you have a VPN login, try searching for airfare while connected to it, as it might have the same effect of altering your registered location and point of sale and, thus, lowering prices.</p>
<p>3.Keep your currency local.
If you’re booking international flights, purchase them in the local currency. (Flights in converted rates are reliably more expensive.) Do this by selecting the native country as your location in the upper right-hand corner of the airline websites.</p>

			<h3>How to dive deeper into local culture?</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/hacks/11.jpg">

<h4>Why don't you try genuine local kitchen?</h4>
<p>It's easy to give up on your diet or general healthy eating plan while you're traveling. Whether the trip is for leisure or business, the constant rush of activities may make it tempting to stop at a fast-food outlet whenever hunger strikes, or indulge in unhealthy snacks or beverages. But if you keep healthy food choices on hand, you may maintain a healthy regimen during your travels with no regrets.</p>
<h5>Avoid touristic food places</h5>
<p>Pack your own meal on the airplane flight or mode of transportation of your choice. This provides you with an alternative to eating the expensive and typically unhealthy prepared meals offered through the airline. Bring protein- and nutrient-dense dry food that won't easily leak or get smashed in your bag. Examples include nuts, protein bars and firm fruit, like apples.</p>
<h5>Ask locals to teach you cooking their national dishes</h5>
<p>Don't forget to eat breakfast. This is usually easier said than done in the whirlwind of a vacation. However, breakfast helps prime your system and prepares you for a full day of activities or business meetings. If your hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, choose a high fiber and protein meal, such as whole grain toast with peanut butter, to give you instant energy and fill you up until lunch. This way you may reduce the temptation to snack in a few hours' time.</p>
<h5>Check for places where locals usually have dinner.</h5>
<p>Avoid fast-food outlets. Though they may be a comforting choice when you're in a new city, these kind of meal options are often high in fat and calories, and more importantly, they may cheat you out of experiencing the local culture. Wherever you decide to eat, focus on meals that incorporate healthy components, like fresh vegetables and lean proteins.Stock your hotel room with bottled water, fresh fruit and healthy snacks like granola bars or fiber cookies. Doing so helps remove the temptation to raid the room's mini bar, and can be indispensable for staving off hunger between business meetings or tourist activities.</p>

			<h3>To drink or not to drink?</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/hacks/15.jpg">

<h4>Water is essential</h4>
<p>Nothing ruins a good trip like getting sick -- and we're not talking about a few extra bathroom stops. Contaminated drinking water is one of the leading sources of health problems for travelers, and can cause anything from mild gastrointestinal distress to serious bacterial diseases.
The most common cause of water-borne illness is bacteria, such as E. coli, cholera and salmonella, but illness can also be caused by protozoa (including giardia and cryptosporidium), viruses (like hepatitis A, polio and rotavirus) and chemical pollutants.
In many cases, travelers become ill simply because the pathogens in the water are foreign to their immune systems, while locals have adapted to the water supply and can drink it without problems.
The best way to protect yourself is to avoid local tap water and instead seek out bottled water; when that's not available, boiling tap water generally kills most micro-organisms, and there are a number of good water filters and purification tablets that can easily be stowed in your carry-on. Read on for tips on how to keep yourself safe, healthy and well-hydrated on your next trip.</p>
<h5>Know the Risks</h5>
<p>Mexico is well known for its unsafe water (Montezuma's revenge, anyone?), but travelers also face high risk in Central America, most of Africa and Asia, and the Middle East. Drinking water is generally safest in developed areas of the world like the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Northern and Western Europe, many parts of the Caribbean, and Japan.
Keep in mind that water quality may vary depending on where you are in a particular country. For example, in Costa Rica you'll probably find safe tap water at a major city hotel, but you may have to boil water before drinking it if you're staying in a small rural village. If you're not sure, consult a reliable guidebook or do some Internet research before you leave.
So-called developed countries aren't necessarily risk-free; cryptosporidium outbreaks have appeared in the U.S. Midwest and Northwest, as well as in highly populated cities in Australia. Giardia has been found in the water supply in St. Petersburg, Russia. Check the Centers for Disease Control's website to see region-specific health info.
Some cities may advertise their drinking water as being chlorinated, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the water is contaminant-free. Your best approach when faced with potentially unsafe drinking water is avoidance.</p>
<h5>What (Not) to Drink</h5>
<p>Bottled water is generally safe, but only in sealed, tamper-proof containers. Ask someone at your hotel to recommend a reliable local brand.
In addition to bottled water, you'll usually be safe drinking tea, coffee, canned soda and juice, beer, wine, and other alcoholic drinks.
Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures will kill many parasites. Drinking from a hot water bottle is slightly safer than drinking untreated cold water.
You don't need to drink contaminated water to be exposed; always consider alternate sources of exposure, like the water you use to brush your teeth, or to wash your contact lenses or dentures. Be sure to use bottled, boiled or purified water for these purposes as well.
Freezing water does not kill bacteria. A margarita on the rocks may sound appealing, but ice cubes present the same problem that tap water does. You can make your own ice if you boil the water first.

			<h3>What is to be a true traveller</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/style/3.jpg">

<h4>Visiting new places is everything!</h4>
<p>With the reflexive approach of tourism as we understand it, the pivot on which tourism hinges is the tourist’s experience. However, before a tourist can be called as such, there is a long way to go. Getting the motivation to go on holiday is the starting point on a complicated road before someone becomes a full fledged tourist. This motivation may be based simply on the fact that this person has only two weeks of vacation per year, or it could also be fueled by a concrete desire to travel to an area that is completely different from the home environment. This motivation may stem from personal reasons, such as difficult home situations, an urge for self-realization or even health concerns, but it may also be inspired by external sources, such as a TV programme, a novel, a nature film or the inspiring stories of friends.</p>
<h5>Traveller's wants and needs</h5>
<p>Motivations create needs that only stop being needs once they have been satisfied. At the moment a need to travel appears, the first expectation will arise automatically. One starts to imagine what things will look like, dreaming about the great experiences one will have, and more or less concrete images of what one wants to experience will start to form. This is what we call the pre-tourist stage. In most cases this stage lasts longer than the holiday itself and consists of a series of well defined steps. Out of motivation and need, the pre-tourist starts forming his first expectations based only on reference material stored in his memory. In this sense these first expectations are authentic, because they are based on personal memory. Once a tourist knows more or less where he wants to go, he starts accumulating more information from external sources and adjusts his expectations accordingly. Although this information may be correct, false or misleading, its only purpose is to feed expectations.</p>
<h5>Decision difficulties</h5>
<p>The decision on where to go and the change from pre-tourist to real tourist means that a fair number of complicated decisions must be made. How much time the tourist has available, the budget, travelling individually or in a group, going by airplane or cruise ship and many more elements must be factored in. Tourists at different ends of this Tourist Lifestyle Scale (TLS) will handle their decisions differently. Those on the allocentric side tend to pay providers directly at the destination as much as possible, while more psycho-centric tourists favour paying home country travel organizations up front, for example.</p>

			<h3>Maldives: relax and privacy</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/13.jpg">

<h4>One of the most popular and gorgeous destinations</h4>
<p>You know that picture that comes pre-loaded on your new laptop? Yes, the one with the palm trees and toothpaste-white beaches. It's probably photographed in the Maldives. Add a hammock, umbrella and icy drink and you'll know why the little country is high up on the world's must-visit list. The Maldives straddles the Equator, so temps don't fluctuate much from the annual average of 30 degrees. </p>
<h5>White sand and crystal blue water</h5>
<p>Of the almost 1200 islands in the Maldivian archipelago, only about 300 are inhabited, and all with the teensiest land masses. The solution? Sleeping over water is de rigueur here. Generally pricier than garden rooms, you can dive straight into a blue lagoon from your over-water living room. </p>
<h5>Underwater world</h5>
<p>The Maldives became a shark sanctuary in 2010 when it banned all shark fishing: take a night dive with grey reef sharks, go hammerhead spotting or watch whale sharks. There's no defined season for the big fellas,  local marine biologists, say. They just appear around bait balls, which are great rolling masses of small, tasty fish. Check out the snorkelling trips in the South Ari Atoll (maldiveswhalesharkresearch.org). If paddling with predators ain't your thing, most lagoons are shark nurseries, and harmless baby grey tips and little lemon sharks are easily spotted on your walk on the jetty to the overwater spa. </p>
<h5>Luxury resorts</h5>
<p>Even if you’re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines hike up prices when you’re buying several seats at once.</p>
<h5>Exclusive service</h5>
<p>Most Maldivian resort spas are over water, preferably with a glass floor so you can watch baby sharks gambol while you're face-down on the massage table. Spa Cenvaree at the new adults-only Centara Ras Fushi Resort Maldives was named  Best Luxury Emerging Spa in the Indian Ocean at the recent 2014 World Luxury Spa Awards (centarahotelsresorts.com), while the  Ayurvedic treatments at Six Senses Spa Laamu (sixsenses.com) and Banyan Tree's luxury Spa Vabbinfaru (banyantree.com) also took home silverware. And you can't go wrong at the One & Only Reethi Rah's ESPA (reethirah.oneandonlyresorts.com/spa.aspx) or the Jiva Grande Spa at the Taj Exotica (tajhotels.com). Of course, the world's first underwater spa is in the Maldives, at Huvafen Fushi resort (huvafenfushi.peraquum.com)</p>

			<h3>Paris is a dream or every woman</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/15.jpg">

<h4>№1 destination for romantic journey</h4>
<p>Paris offers the largest concentration  of tourist attractions in France, and possibly in Europe. Besides some of the world's most famous musuems, its has a vibrant historic city centre, a beautiful riverscape, an extensive range of historic monuments, including cathedrals, chapels and palaces, plus one of the most famous nightlife scenes in the world.  
     Paris is also famous for its cafés and restaurants, its theatres and cinemas, and its general ambiance. While there are a thousand other things to do in Paris apart from those mentioned on this page, for the traveller spending just a few days in Paris   , this list offers more than enough choice to fill the time. Note that national museums (i.e. the main museums) are generally closed on Tuesdays - though a few, including the Musée d'Orsay, are closed on Mondays.</p>
<h5>The Louvre </h5>
<p>Closed Tuesdays - one of the world's great art galleries, with masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa (which is known in French as La Joconde), and works by almost all the greatest painters. The Louvre is also a major museum, with an exceptionally rich collection of antiquities and artefacts, including Egyptian mummies, Classical bronzes, and artefacts from round the world.  Expect long queues at busy moments, unless you have a pass.
</p>
<h5>French dishes</h5>
<p>There are thousands of restaurants to choose from in Paris; as well as plenty of French restaurants, there are hundreds of Italian restaurants, pizzerias, Vietnamese restaurants, and restuarants serving food from just about every country in the world.  There are also interesting French regional restaurants, serving traditional regional dishes.
  There are restaurants all over Paris, because Paris is very much a lived-in city. The best concentrations of top-class restaurants in Paris are near the Champs Elysees, in the 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements, where there are a good number of Michelin starred restaurants. For more affordable eating, and plenty of choice and atmosphere,  try the small streets in the Latin quarter (5th and 6th districts), or on the Ile St. Louis. 

   For the best oriental cuisine, go to the Paris Chinatown, south from the Place d'Italie in the 13th</h5>
<p>Even if you’re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines hike up prices when you’re buying several seats at once.</p>
<h5>Eifel's tower</h5>
<p>The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. Its construction in 2 years, 2 months and 5 days was a veritable technical and architectural achievement. "Utopia achieved", a symbol of technological prowess, at the end of the 19th Century it was a demonstration of French engineering personified by Gustave Eiffel, and a defining moment of the industrial era. It was met immediately with tremendous success.
Only intended to last 20 years, it was saved by the scientific experiments that Eiffel encouraged, and in particular by the first radio transmissions, followed by telecommunications. For example, the radio signals from the Pantheon Tower in 1898; it served as a military radio post in 1903; it transmitted the first public radio programme in 1925, and then broadcast television up to TNT more recently.
Since the 1980s, the monument has regularly been renovated, restored and adapted for an ever-growing public.
Over the decades, the Eiffel Tower has seen remarkable achievements, extraordinary light shows, and prestigious visitors. A mythical and audacious site, it has always inspired artists and challenges.
It is the stage for numerous events of international significance (light shows, the Tower’s centenary, the Year 2000 pyrotechnic show, repainting campaigns, sparkling lights, the blue Tower to mark France’s Presidency of the European Union or the multicoloured Tower for its 120th birthday, unusual fixtures, such as an ice rink, a garden etc.).
A universal Tower of Babel, almost 250 million visitors regardless of age or origin have come from all over the planet to see it since its opening in 1889.</p>

			<h3>Singapore is a completely another world built in 50 years only</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/20.jpg">

<h4>Small does not mean weak</h4>
<p>Singapore is just 719.1 square kilometres big. Yet, despite its humble size, the island packs a punch with a blend of elements that come together in unexpected symphony. From old-school buildings alongside uber-modern architectural marvels, to street food served up side by side with internationally acclaimed gourmet fare, the city itself is a celebration of diversity that goes beyond the postcard-perfect sight of steely skyscrapers. Here are five fascinating contrasts to look out for:</p>
<h5>Food</h5>
<p>One big reason why Singaporeans love food: even the local street (hawker) fare garners Michelin stars. Join the snaking queues at one-Michelin-starred hawker stalls — the world’s first — Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle on Crawford Lane and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle in Chinatown Complex. For even more traditional fare, breathe in a whiff of nostalgia as you order bak chang (traditional Chinese rice dumplings) at the time-honoured hawker stall Hoo Kee Bak Chang in Amoy Food Street Centre.
Besides its thriving hawker scene, the city is also at the forefront of gastronomic innovation. Expand your culinary vocabulary with chef Willin Low’s “Mod-Sin” (Modern Singaporean) cuisine at Wild Rocket — he remixes local dishes such as laksa (spicy coconut-milk based noodle soup) and congee with European techniques. Alternatively, head to Corner House in UNESCO World Heritage Site Singapore Botanic Gardens to find out what cutting-edge ‘Gastro-Botanica’ cuisine really means. Hint: it has something to do with plants.
</p>
<h5>Architecture</h5>
<p>The juxtaposition of historic and contemporary architecture in a city can evoke a beauty that is more than the sum of its parts. For a taste of the modern, take a whirl around bustling Raffles Place. Towering skyscrapers glint back at you from every direction, with the 43-floor Ocean Financial Centre and Singapore’s tallest hotel Swissotel The Stamford being a few of the pinnacles that dot the skyline.
Down on the streets, historic neighbourhoods reveal architectural marvels that look straight out of a history textbook. Snap a photo of the colourful two-storey shophouses around Joo Chiat, where Peranakan (Straits Chinese) heritage has been preserved. Or jaunt around hip enclave Tiong Bahru and spot pre-war buildings inspired by transportation of the 1920s. Think aviation-inspired blocks, nautical elements and clean lines in the design.</p>
<h5>International events versus local festivities.</h5>
<p>The city never sleeps when world-class events and local celebrations alike dot the calendar. As a cosmopolitan nation, Singapore plays host to many international festivals and events that set the city abuzz — such as the Grand Prix Season Singapore 2016. Besides the adrenaline-pumping action on the tracks, the city revs up with parties, exclusive dining and entertainment offers, and more. Rub shoulders with the jet-set crowd at world-renowned bash Amber Lounge, or dance up a storm at electronic dance music behemoth Ultra Singapore.
Join in festivities of a more traditional kind, too — head to districts such as Chinatown or Little India, where lights fill the streets with pomp and colour during Chinese New Year and Deepavali, respectively. To truly soak up the festive spirit, inhale the aromatic scents of flowers or spices at the sprawling bazaars in Little India, or cheer on the lion dancers and fire-eaters as they perform along Chinatown Street.</p>
<h5>Nature versus nurture</h5>
<p>We’re not talking about the age-old question of psychology here. Despite Singapore’s evolution into a modern city, many pockets of lush greenery remain. Get close to Mother Nature at Kranji Marshes, the largest freshwater marshland in Singapore, developed way back in the 1970s. As you clamber up to its observatory for a bird’s-eye view, keep your eyes peeled for over 170 species of birds and insects. For an alternative nature escapade, take a bumboat back in time to off-shore island Pulau Ubin, one of the two remaining kampongs (rural village) in Singapore.
If you’re wondering about the island’s moniker of ‘City in a Garden’, look up at the Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay for a futuristic interpretation of a park. Amid the surrounding waterfront gardens, these iconic structures are man-made marvels — the defining touches of a horticultural destination that is truly ‘nurtured’ into existence.
</p>
<h5>Shopping</h5>
<p>Shopaholics, get ready to part with your cash. Start with retail therapy at Bugis Street Village, known for ridiculously cheap steals (from SGD 5 for clothing) and its wide array of souvenirs such as magnets, silver accessories and T-shirts — bring a few home! To pick up fashion with a unique twist, hop on over to nearby Haji Lane in Kampong Glam, where eclectic boutiques nestle among narrow alleys and vibrant murals.
If you have a soft spot for designer brands such as Prada and Gucci, heed the siren call of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Pop into the Chanel boutique for that latest ‘It’ bag, or to the Louis Vuitton flagship store outside. Housed in a floating Crystal Pavilion, it’s the label’s largest store outside of Paris.
But if you’re pressed for time, at the very least, squeeze in a stroll down Singapore’s iconic shopping belt, Orchard Road, where you can fill your bags with anything from designer threads to fast fashion. From hidden nature spots to glitzy malls to grand festivals, Singapore’s ever-expanding roster of activities and destinations will entertain even the most jaded of travellers. The only problem is: where do you start?</p>

			<h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/newdest/7.jpg">

<h4>What is Abu Dhabi about?</h4>
<p>Capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is a well-ordered, industrious city with a pretty waterside location. First inhabited by the nomadic Bani Yas tribe in 1760, the settlement remained a small fishing village until oil was discovered. The revenues transformed Abu Dhabi into the modern city of today - a bustling centre of government and business.</p>
<h5>Dubai again and again? No thanks!</h5>
<p>Book at the right time. For domestic flights, 47 days out is considered the median best time to buy, while international travel varies by destination and should be purchased further in advance of your preferred departure date. If your dates are flexible, searching a +3/-3 (or 5/7) date range will yield a wide array of prices for you to consider.
Don’t book too early. So you know when and where you’re going—but don’t get overzealous! The average domestic fare found six months before a selected departure date was found to be 19% higher than fares searched for a month in advance.</p>
<h5>Sheikh Zayed Mosque</h5>
<p>Clad in Macedonian marble, the beautiful and absolutely mammoth Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is Abu Dhabi's landmark building. The mosque fuses Mameluke, Ottoman and Fatamid design elements to create a harmonious and thoroughly modern mosque that celebrates Islamic architecture. Artisans utilised glass-work, mosaic tiling and intricate carvings to spectacular effect on both the interior and exterior. It was opened in 2007 after nearly 20 years of construction.</p>
<h5>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi</h5>
<p>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi is designed for those with an appetite for G-force and velocity. Home to the world’s fastest rollercoaster, this is the only place on the planet where you can be blasted to 240km/h in 4.9 seconds, just for fun! Take a look at just a few of our favourite things to do at this one of a kind theme park.</p>
<h5>Rides and shows</h5>
<p>VFerrari World Abu Dhabi has a host of thrilling Ferrari-themed rides and attractions that will get your heart racing! From state-of-the-art simulators and record breaking rides to immersive and interactive family-friendly attractions, this is a day out for everyone. Here’s just a little flavour of what’s in store at the world’s only Ferrari-branded theme park.</p>
<h5>Heritage Village</h5>
<p>Right next to the Heritage Village is a little mosque, a flagpole which was once the tallest in the world, till Jordan exceeded.Abu Dhabi is famous for it's Corniche a 8 Km paved path along the waterfront facing the bay with a view of Lulu island.Great beach, exotic blue water... Chairs are for free. Best view on the skyline. </p>

			<h3>Jordan is a new Egypt</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/newdest/8.jpg">

<h4>Fed up with Egypt?</h4>
<p>The Do and Don’t listing is something that I have always enjoyed watching on travel specials and am throwing my hand into the style with this feature. While some of these features are often in the style of “you must do this” and “you might as well miss that,” this version will be formatted in a different way and in no way tell you not to do something major, as my misfortune might be someone else’s highlight. Instead, the “Do” will feature a specific place or thing to do in the destination that are great sites and experiences, and the “Don’t” will spotlight things to keep in mind during that activity that are not well known and publicized when planning the trip.</h5>
<p>The Dead Sea is not only the lowest point on Earth, but the saltiest body of water out there.  As up until recently it was thought that nothing could survive in the waters of the Dead Sea, the name becomes apparent.  The most popular activity in the Dead Sea is taking advantage of its high salinity and floating for as long as you desire with absolutely no effort at all.  The feeling is weird, and the Dead Sea is one of the few places on Earth where this is feasible.
One of the side activities you can do at the Dead Sea is get a full body mud bath for only a few dollars.  It is said that the mud on the floor of the Dead Sea is rich in minerals due to the high salt content and offer a number of positive effects on the body.   Since it is cheap, do it!  But be sure to avoid putting it on your face, or else you will experience the pain that several of my tour members did while washing it off their face with the salt water from the Dead Sea.</p>
<h5>Red sea</h5>
<p>Wadi Rum may sound familiar to you, and it is because it is the location of the history depicted in the Lawrence of Arabia movie (and the movie was filmed there as well, naturally).   Much like any desert in the Middle East, you can go and camp with the Bedouin and really begin to explore the surrounding desert.  A multi-hour 4×4 ride in the desert is one of the best ways to get out and really appreciate the scenery.
The reason this is a must-see is that the geography of Wadi Rum changes quite significantly in relatively short distances.   Most rides to Bedouin camps give way to beautiful scenery like in the photo above, but a true exploration will bring you to large natural arches, ancient wall carvings, and beautiful rose colored rock formations to name a few.   But for those not interested in a long day in the desert, a trip to the camel race track is another option that would be hard to pass up</p>
<h5>Petra</h5>
<p>Petra is one of those places you see on television and movies and instantly dream of going there.  The main thing that these images leave out is that the ruins of Petra are actually in a massive complex that is significantly larger than you would expect.  In fact, before I went I had no idea that the hike from the iconic Treasury to the Monastery, the second most popular spot in the complex, was a several hour hike that had me practically climb a mountain to get there. In 100°F+ (38°C) weather, the hike is not for the faint of heart.
Luckily the Bedouin that live and work in Petra cater to tourists and offer donkey rides to the top.  We made the trek, and no matter how difficult it was I was rewarded for the effort.   Before giving up, make the extra few minute hike from there to the View of the End of the World.  It is worth it.</p>
<h5>The same climate</h5>
<p>Kerak and Shobak Castles are two of the many castles built during the Crusade period of the 1100s.   Due to their notable history in the world, Kerak and Shobak are now popular attractions sitting in the Jordanian countryside.  Unfortunately for the castles, time has not been on their side, as the compounds have fallen into a substantial form of ruin.  Beautiful architecture still remains, but the original glory of each has been lost to the ages.
For what it is worth, a visit to these castles may be quick for some and longer for others.  As much as exploring the ruins of castles from the Crusades is a dream for many, I much more enjoyed the views from these castles as they are perched high above the surrounding region.    If you do decide to visit these castles, I highly recommend reading up on them before visiting as the history is not presented very well at either sight.</p>
