						<h3>Grab some filters for your photo lens!</h3>

						<h4>Take more photos</h4>

						<p>With the reflexive approach of tourism as we understand it, the pivot on which tourism hinges is the tourist’s experience. However, before a tourist can be called as such, there is a long way to go. Getting the motivation to go on holiday is the starting point on a complicated road before someone becomes a full fledged tourist. This motivation may be based simply on the fact that this person has only two weeks of vacation per year, or it could also be fueled by a concrete desire to travel to an area that is completely different from the home environment. This motivation may stem from personal reasons, such as difficult home situations, an urge for self-realization or even health concerns, but it may also be inspired by external sources, such as a TV programme, a novel, a nature film or the inspiring stories of friends.</p>

						<h5>Create awesome photo books</h5>

						<p>Motivations create needs that only stop being needs once they have been satisfied. At the moment a need to travel appears, the first expectation will arise automatically. One starts to imagine what things will look like, dreaming about the great experiences one will have, and more or less concrete images of what one wants to experience will start to form. This is what we call the pre-tourist stage. In most cases this stage lasts longer than the holiday itself and consists of a series of well defined steps. Out of motivation and need, the pre-tourist starts forming his first expectations based only on reference material stored in his memory. In this sense these first expectations are authentic, because they are based on personal memory. Once a tourist knows more or less where he wants to go, he starts accumulating more information from external sources and adjusts his expectations accordingly. Although this information may be correct, false or misleading, its only purpose is to feed expectations.</p>

						<h5>Be creative</h5>

						<p>The decision on where to go and the change from pre-tourist to real tourist means that a fair number of complicated decisions must be made. How much time the tourist has available, the budget, travelling individually or in a group, going by airplane or cruise ship and many more elements must be factored in. Tourists at different ends of this Tourist Lifestyle Scale (TLS) will handle their decisions differently. Those on the allocentric side tend to pay providers directly at the destination as much as possible, while more psycho-centric tourists favour paying home country travel organizations up front, for example.</p>

						<h4>Visiting new places is everything!</h4>
