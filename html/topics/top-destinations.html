			<h3>Maldives: relax and privacy</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>
			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/13.jpg" alt="maldives.jpg">

			<h4>One of the most popular and gorgeous destinations</h4>

			<p>You know that picture that comes pre-loaded on your new laptop? Yes, the one with the palm trees and toothpaste-white beaches. It's probably photographed in the Maldives. Add a hammock, umbrella and icy drink and you'll know why the little country is high up on the world's must-visit list. The Maldives straddles the Equator, so temps don't fluctuate much from the annual average of 30 degrees. </p>

			<h5>White sand and crystal blue water</h5>

			<p>Of the almost 1200 islands in the Maldivian archipelago, only about 300 are inhabited, and all with the teensiest land masses. The solution? Sleeping over water is de rigueur here. Generally pricier than garden rooms, you can dive straight into a blue lagoon from your over-water living room. </p>

			<h5>Underwater world</h5>

			<p>The Maldives became a shark sanctuary in 2010 when it banned all shark fishing: take a night dive with grey reef sharks, go hammerhead spotting or watch whale sharks. There's no defined season for the big fellas,  local marine biologists, say. They just appear around bait balls, which are great rolling masses of small, tasty fish. Check out the snorkelling trips in the South Ari Atoll (maldiveswhalesharkresearch.org). If paddling with predators ain't your thing, most lagoons are shark nurseries, and harmless baby grey tips and little lemon sharks are easily spotted on your walk on the jetty to the overwater spa. </p>

			<h5>Luxury resorts</h5>

			<p>Even if you’re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines hike up prices when you’re buying several seats at once.</p>

			<h5>Exclusive service</h5>

			<p>Most Maldivian resort spas are over water, preferably with a glass floor so you can watch baby sharks gambol while you're face-down on the massage table. Spa Cenvaree at the new adults-only Centara Ras Fushi Resort Maldives was named  Best Luxury Emerging Spa in the Indian Ocean at the recent 2014 World Luxury Spa Awards (centarahotelsresorts.com), while the  Ayurvedic treatments at Six Senses Spa Laamu (sixsenses.com) and Banyan Tree's luxury Spa Vabbinfaru (banyantree.com) also took home silverware. And you can't go wrong at the One and Only Reethi Rah's ESPA (reethirah.oneandonlyresorts.com/spa.aspx) or the Jiva Grande Spa at the Taj Exotica (tajhotels.com). Of course, the world's first underwater spa is in the Maldives, at Huvafen Fushi resort (huvafenfushi.peraquum.com)</p>

				<h3>Paris is a dream or every woman</h3>
				<p class="date-of-posting"></p>
				<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/15.jpg" alt="paris.jpg">

				<h4>№1 destination for romantic journey</h4>

				<p>Paris offers the largest concentration  of tourist attractions in France, and possibly in Europe. Besides some of the world's most famous musuems, its has a vibrant historic city centre, a beautiful riverscape, an extensive range of historic monuments, including cathedrals, chapels and palaces, plus one of the most famous nightlife scenes in the world.  
				Paris is also famous for its cafés and restaurants, its theatres and cinemas, and its general ambiance. While there are a thousand other things to do in Paris apart from those mentioned on this page, for the traveller spending just a few days in Paris   , this list offers more than enough choice to fill the time. Note that national museums (i.e. the main museums) are generally closed on Tuesdays - though a few, including the Musée d'Orsay, are closed on Mondays.</p>

				<h5>The Louvre </h5>

				<p>Closed Tuesdays - one of the world's great art galleries, with masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa (which is known in French as La Joconde), and works by almost all the greatest painters. The Louvre is also a major museum, with an exceptionally rich collection of antiquities and artefacts, including Egyptian mummies, Classical bronzes, and artefacts from round the world.  Expect long queues at busy moments, unless you have a pass.
				</p>

				<h5>French dishes</h5>

				<p>There are thousands of restaurants to choose from in Paris; as well as plenty of French restaurants, there are hundreds of Italian restaurants, pizzerias, Vietnamese restaurants, and restuarants serving food from just about every country in the world.  There are also interesting French regional restaurants, serving traditional regional dishes.
				There are restaurants all over Paris, because Paris is very much a lived-in city. The best concentrations of top-class restaurants in Paris are near the Champs Elysees, in the 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements, where there are a good number of Michelin starred restaurants. For more affordable eating, and plenty of choice and atmosphere,  try the small streets in the Latin quarter (5th and 6th districts), or on the Ile St. Louis.</p>

				<h5>Eifel's tower</h5>

				<p>The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which was to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. Its construction in 2 years, 2 months and 5 days was a veritable technical and architectural achievement. "Utopia achieved", a symbol of technological prowess, at the end of the 19th Century it was a demonstration of French engineering personified by Gustave Eiffel, and a defining moment of the industrial era. It was met immediately with tremendous success.
				Only intended to last 20 years, it was saved by the scientific experiments that Eiffel encouraged, and in particular by the first radio transmissions, followed by telecommunications. For example, the radio signals from the Pantheon Tower in 1898; it served as a military radio post in 1903; it transmitted the first public radio programme in 1925, and then broadcast television up to TNT more recently.
				Since the 1980s, the monument has regularly been renovated, restored and adapted for an ever-growing public.
				Over the decades, the Eiffel Tower has seen remarkable achievements, extraordinary light shows, and prestigious visitors. A mythical and audacious site, it has always inspired artists and challenges.
				It is the stage for numerous events of international significance (light shows, the Tower’s centenary, the Year 2000 pyrotechnic show, repainting campaigns, sparkling lights, the blue Tower to mark France’s Presidency of the European Union or the multicoloured Tower for its 120th birthday, unusual fixtures, such as an ice rink, a garden etc.).
				A universal Tower of Babel, almost 250 million visitors regardless of age or origin have come from all over the planet to see it since its opening in 1889.</p>

			<h3>Singapore is a completely another world built in 50 years only</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/topdest/20.jpg" alt="singapore.jpg">

			<h4>Small does not mean weak</h4>

			<p>Singapore is just 719.1 square kilometres big. Yet, despite its humble size, the island packs a punch with a blend of elements that come together in unexpected symphony. From old-school buildings alongside uber-modern architectural marvels, to street food served up side by side with internationally acclaimed gourmet fare, the city itself is a celebration of diversity that goes beyond the postcard-perfect sight of steely skyscrapers. Here are five fascinating contrasts to look out for:</p>

			<h5>Food</h5>

			<p>One big reason why Singaporeans love food: even the local street (hawker) fare garners Michelin stars. Join the snaking queues at one-Michelin-starred hawker stalls — the world’s first — Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle on Crawford Lane and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle in Chinatown Complex. For even more traditional fare, breathe in a whiff of nostalgia as you order bak chang (traditional Chinese rice dumplings) at the time-honoured hawker stall Hoo Kee Bak Chang in Amoy Food Street Centre.
			Besides its thriving hawker scene, the city is also at the forefront of gastronomic innovation. Expand your culinary vocabulary with chef Willin Low’s “Mod-Sin” (Modern Singaporean) cuisine at Wild Rocket — he remixes local dishes such as laksa (spicy coconut-milk based noodle soup) and congee with European techniques. Alternatively, head to Corner House in UNESCO World Heritage Site Singapore Botanic Gardens to find out what cutting-edge ‘Gastro-Botanica’ cuisine really means. Hint: it has something to do with plants.</p>

			<h5>Architecture</h5>

			<p>The juxtaposition of historic and contemporary architecture in a city can evoke a beauty that is more than the sum of its parts. For a taste of the modern, take a whirl around bustling Raffles Place. Towering skyscrapers glint back at you from every direction, with the 43-floor Ocean Financial Centre and Singapore’s tallest hotel Swissotel The Stamford being a few of the pinnacles that dot the skyline.
			Down on the streets, historic neighbourhoods reveal architectural marvels that look straight out of a history textbook. Snap a photo of the colourful two-storey shophouses around Joo Chiat, where Peranakan (Straits Chinese) heritage has been preserved. Or jaunt around hip enclave Tiong Bahru and spot pre-war buildings inspired by transportation of the 1920s. Think aviation-inspired blocks, nautical elements and clean lines in the design.</p>

			<h5>International events versus local festivities.</h5>

			<p>The city never sleeps when world-class events and local celebrations alike dot the calendar. As a cosmopolitan nation, Singapore plays host to many international festivals and events that set the city abuzz — such as the Grand Prix Season Singapore 2016. Besides the adrenaline-pumping action on the tracks, the city revs up with parties, exclusive dining and entertainment offers, and more. Rub shoulders with the jet-set crowd at world-renowned bash Amber Lounge, or dance up a storm at electronic dance music behemoth Ultra Singapore.
			Join in festivities of a more traditional kind, too — head to districts such as Chinatown or Little India, where lights fill the streets with pomp and colour during Chinese New Year and Deepavali, respectively. To truly soak up the festive spirit, inhale the aromatic scents of flowers or spices at the sprawling bazaars in Little India, or cheer on the lion dancers and fire-eaters as they perform along Chinatown Street.</p>

			<h5>Nature versus nurture</h5>

			<p>We’re not talking about the age-old question of psychology here. Despite Singapore’s evolution into a modern city, many pockets of lush greenery remain. Get close to Mother Nature at Kranji Marshes, the largest freshwater marshland in Singapore, developed way back in the 1970s. As you clamber up to its observatory for a bird’s-eye view, keep your eyes peeled for over 170 species of birds and insects. For an alternative nature escapade, take a bumboat back in time to off-shore island Pulau Ubin, one of the two remaining kampongs (rural village) in Singapore.
			If you’re wondering about the island’s moniker of ‘City in a Garden’, look up at the Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay for a futuristic interpretation of a park. Amid the surrounding waterfront gardens, these iconic structures are man-made marvels — the defining touches of a horticultural destination that is truly ‘nurtured’ into existence.</p>

			<h5>Shopping</h5>

			<p>Shopaholics, get ready to part with your cash. Start with retail therapy at Bugis Street Village, known for ridiculously cheap steals (from SGD 5 for clothing) and its wide array of souvenirs such as magnets, silver accessories and T-shirts — bring a few home! To pick up fashion with a unique twist, hop on over to nearby Haji Lane in Kampong Glam, where eclectic boutiques nestle among narrow alleys and vibrant murals.
			If you have a soft spot for designer brands such as Prada and Gucci, heed the siren call of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Pop into the Chanel boutique for that latest ‘It’ bag, or to the Louis Vuitton flagship store outside. Housed in a floating Crystal Pavilion, it’s the label’s largest store outside of Paris.
			But if you’re pressed for time, at the very least, squeeze in a stroll down Singapore’s iconic shopping belt, Orchard Road, where you can fill your bags with anything from designer threads to fast fashion. From hidden nature spots to glitzy malls to grand festivals, Singapore’s ever-expanding roster of activities and destinations will entertain even the most jaded of travellers. The only problem is: where do you start?</p>
