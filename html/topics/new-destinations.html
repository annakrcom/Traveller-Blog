				<h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
				<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

				<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/newdest/7.jpg">

<h4>What is Abu Dhabi about?</h4>
<p>Capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is a well-ordered, industrious city with a pretty waterside location. First inhabited by the nomadic Bani Yas tribe in 1760, the settlement remained a small fishing village until oil was discovered. The revenues transformed Abu Dhabi into the modern city of today - a bustling centre of government and business.</p>
<h5>Dubai again and again? No thanks!</h5>
<p>Book at the right time. For domestic flights, 47 days out is considered the median best time to buy, while international travel varies by destination and should be purchased further in advance of your preferred departure date. If your dates are flexible, searching a +3/-3 (or 5/7) date range will yield a wide array of prices for you to consider.
Don’t book too early. So you know when and where you’re going—but don’t get overzealous! The average domestic fare found six months before a selected departure date was found to be 19% higher than fares searched for a month in advance.</p>
<h5>Sheikh Zayed Mosque</h5>
<p>Clad in Macedonian marble, the beautiful and absolutely mammoth Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is Abu Dhabi's landmark building. The mosque fuses Mameluke, Ottoman and Fatamid design elements to create a harmonious and thoroughly modern mosque that celebrates Islamic architecture. Artisans utilised glass-work, mosaic tiling and intricate carvings to spectacular effect on both the interior and exterior. It was opened in 2007 after nearly 20 years of construction.</p>
<h5>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi</h5>
<p>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi is designed for those with an appetite for G-force and velocity. Home to the world’s fastest rollercoaster, this is the only place on the planet where you can be blasted to 240km/h in 4.9 seconds, just for fun! Take a look at just a few of our favourite things to do at this one of a kind theme park.</p>
<h5>Rides and shows</h5>
<p>VFerrari World Abu Dhabi has a host of thrilling Ferrari-themed rides and attractions that will get your heart racing! From state-of-the-art simulators and record breaking rides to immersive and interactive family-friendly attractions, this is a day out for everyone. Here’s just a little flavour of what’s in store at the world’s only Ferrari-branded theme park.</p>
<h5>Heritage Village</h5>
<p>Right next to the Heritage Village is a little mosque, a flagpole which was once the tallest in the world, till Jordan exceeded.Abu Dhabi is famous for it's Corniche a 8 Km paved path along the waterfront facing the bay with a view of Lulu island.Great beach, exotic blue water... Chairs are for free. Best view on the skyline. </p>

			<h3>Jordan is a new Egypt</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/newdest/8.jpg">

<h4>Fed up with Egypt?</h4>
<p>The Do and Don’t listing is something that I have always enjoyed watching on travel specials and am throwing my hand into the style with this feature. While some of these features are often in the style of “you must do this” and “you might as well miss that,” this version will be formatted in a different way and in no way tell you not to do something major, as my misfortune might be someone else’s highlight. Instead, the “Do” will feature a specific place or thing to do in the destination that are great sites and experiences, and the “Don’t” will spotlight things to keep in mind during that activity that are not well known and publicized when planning the trip.</h5>
<p>The Dead Sea is not only the lowest point on Earth, but the saltiest body of water out there.  As up until recently it was thought that nothing could survive in the waters of the Dead Sea, the name becomes apparent.  The most popular activity in the Dead Sea is taking advantage of its high salinity and floating for as long as you desire with absolutely no effort at all.  The feeling is weird, and the Dead Sea is one of the few places on Earth where this is feasible.
One of the side activities you can do at the Dead Sea is get a full body mud bath for only a few dollars.  It is said that the mud on the floor of the Dead Sea is rich in minerals due to the high salt content and offer a number of positive effects on the body.   Since it is cheap, do it!  But be sure to avoid putting it on your face, or else you will experience the pain that several of my tour members did while washing it off their face with the salt water from the Dead Sea.</p>
<h5>Red sea</h5>
<p>Wadi Rum may sound familiar to you, and it is because it is the location of the history depicted in the Lawrence of Arabia movie (and the movie was filmed there as well, naturally).   Much like any desert in the Middle East, you can go and camp with the Bedouin and really begin to explore the surrounding desert.  A multi-hour 4×4 ride in the desert is one of the best ways to get out and really appreciate the scenery.
The reason this is a must-see is that the geography of Wadi Rum changes quite significantly in relatively short distances.   Most rides to Bedouin camps give way to beautiful scenery like in the photo above, but a true exploration will bring you to large natural arches, ancient wall carvings, and beautiful rose colored rock formations to name a few.   But for those not interested in a long day in the desert, a trip to the camel race track is another option that would be hard to pass up</p>
<h5>Petra</h5>
<p>Petra is one of those places you see on television and movies and instantly dream of going there.  The main thing that these images leave out is that the ruins of Petra are actually in a massive complex that is significantly larger than you would expect.  In fact, before I went I had no idea that the hike from the iconic Treasury to the Monastery, the second most popular spot in the complex, was a several hour hike that had me practically climb a mountain to get there. In 100°F+ (38°C) weather, the hike is not for the faint of heart.
Luckily the Bedouin that live and work in Petra cater to tourists and offer donkey rides to the top.  We made the trek, and no matter how difficult it was I was rewarded for the effort.   Before giving up, make the extra few minute hike from there to the View of the End of the World.  It is worth it.</p>
<h5>The same climate</h5>
<p>Kerak and Shobak Castles are two of the many castles built during the Crusade period of the 1100s.   Due to their notable history in the world, Kerak and Shobak are now popular attractions sitting in the Jordanian countryside.  Unfortunately for the castles, time has not been on their side, as the compounds have fallen into a substantial form of ruin.  Beautiful architecture still remains, but the original glory of each has been lost to the ages.
For what it is worth, a visit to these castles may be quick for some and longer for others.  As much as exploring the ruins of castles from the Crusades is a dream for many, I much more enjoyed the views from these castles as they are perched high above the surrounding region.    If you do decide to visit these castles, I highly recommend reading up on them before visiting as the history is not presented very well at either sight.</p>
