			<h3>How to travel on a budget?</h3>

<h4>A few air tickets tricks for you!</h4>
<p>It’s no secret that we love a good deal, but this is especially true for travel. A new survey by Experian shows that the majority of vacationers spend more money than expected when traveling, so any savings we can drum up in advance is a great help. We’ve often heard that flying in and out of secondary airports can help you save, and everyone knows that Tuesday is the magic day to book, but what are other tried-and-true tricks are there? We dug deep to find the best insider hacks to turn that epic getaway you’re planning into an epic steal—read on.</p>
<h5>Timing</h5>
<p>Book at the right time. For domestic flights, 47 days out is considered the median best time to buy, while international travel varies by destination and should be purchased further in advance of your preferred departure date. If your dates are flexible, searching a +3/-3 (or 5/7) date range will yield a wide array of prices for you to consider.
Don’t book too early. So you know when and where you’re going—but don’t get overzealous! The average domestic fare found six months before a selected departure date was found to be 19% higher than fares searched for a month in advance.</p>
<h5>Itinerary</h5>
<p>Go multi-city. Once upon a time, a round-trip ticket into and out of the same city was the cheapest—only!—way to go. Not anymore. Sometimes, flying into one city and out of another will yield better prices.
Go one-way. Just as round-trip tickets into and out of the same city used to be the way to go, so too is the case for round-trip tickets in general. Two one-way tickets may in fact be cheaper than a full round-trip ticket, so don’t forget to check just to see.
Keep an open mind. In need of an escape but don’t care where to? Type “Everywhere” as your destination city on Skyscanner, and you’ll get a list of the cheapest flights all around the world. Who knows? You may stumble upon your dream getaway!
Consider stitching. If you’re not on a very tight travel crunch, building in a layover will almost always save you dollar bills. If you can make that layover functional (so, a half or full day!) and in a city you wouldn’t mind exploring, all the better. The trick is to not necessarily select a flight with a traditional layover, but instead to “stitch” separate tickets and flights together. So, a one-way to Paris followed by another one-way to Buenos Aires might be cheaper than a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires, with or without a stop.</p>
<h5>Check one-person flights first.</h5>
<p>Even if you’re booking for the entire family, be sure to do a separate search for the flights set to one person first. Many airlines hike up prices when you’re buying several seats at once.</p>
<h5>Tools</h5>
<p>Vary your search. Check aggregator sites such as Kayak, Orbitz, Skyscanner, and Airfarewatchdog as well as the individual websites of the airlines you are interested in; sometimes direct airline websites will have the best deals. Momondo.com pulls in every flight that exists, including lesser-known budget airlines, and usually has the cheapest flights (Kayak.com is a great tool, but it actually removed budget airlines from its search, so it doesn't always provide you with the widest range of options).
Use the right tools. Hopper, for example, analyzes flight prices daily and will notify you as prices drop. It also has a predictive feature built in. Hipmunk allows you to search date ranges to compare all of your options in one low-stress results page. Skyscanner is great if you’re deciding between a few different trips. You can compare prices for different trips and dates, and can also set alerts for particular routes and dates.
Trade your points. Points.com allows you to exchange, buy, and sell points from various loyalty programs. Trading or buying a few extra miles might be all you need to earn a travel reward.</p>
<h5>Secrets</h5>
<p>1.Clear your cookies.
 When searching for flights, clear your cookies or cache, or hop onto a different computer so that your browsing history doesn’t follow you. Peter Greenberg for Quartz tells us, “While there’s no proof or hard evidence, there is growing anecdotal evidence that suggests airlines are tracking your behavior online, and potentially even tracking IP addresses, and prices could go up for flights that are searched frequently.” While you’re at it, set your particular web browser to incognito or private browsing mode when shopping for fares. In Chrome or Safari, incognito is enabled by hitting Command (or Control, if using PC)+Shift+N. For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or Control, if using a PC)+Shift+P.</p>
<p>2.Use a fake point of sale.
International ticket prices, and especially domestic flights while in another country, can be cheaper depending on where you’re searching from. Follow these directions to adjust your point of sale and save. If you have a VPN login, try searching for airfare while connected to it, as it might have the same effect of altering your registered location and point of sale and, thus, lowering prices.</p>
<p>3.Keep your currency local.
If you’re booking international flights, purchase them in the local currency. (Flights in converted rates are reliably more expensive.) Do this by selecting the native country as your location in the upper right-hand corner of the airline websites.</p>

			<h3>How to dive deeper into local culture?</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/hacks/11.jpg">

<h4>Why don't you try genuine local kitchen?</h4>
<p>It's easy to give up on your diet or general healthy eating plan while you're traveling. Whether the trip is for leisure or business, the constant rush of activities may make it tempting to stop at a fast-food outlet whenever hunger strikes, or indulge in unhealthy snacks or beverages. But if you keep healthy food choices on hand, you may maintain a healthy regimen during your travels with no regrets.</p>
<h5>Avoid touristic food places</h5>
<p>Pack your own meal on the airplane flight or mode of transportation of your choice. This provides you with an alternative to eating the expensive and typically unhealthy prepared meals offered through the airline. Bring protein- and nutrient-dense dry food that won't easily leak or get smashed in your bag. Examples include nuts, protein bars and firm fruit, like apples.</p>
<h5>Ask locals to teach you cooking their national dishes</h5>
<p>Don't forget to eat breakfast. This is usually easier said than done in the whirlwind of a vacation. However, breakfast helps prime your system and prepares you for a full day of activities or business meetings. If your hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, choose a high fiber and protein meal, such as whole grain toast with peanut butter, to give you instant energy and fill you up until lunch. This way you may reduce the temptation to snack in a few hours' time.</p>
<h5>Check for places where locals usually have dinner.</h5>
<p>Avoid fast-food outlets. Though they may be a comforting choice when you're in a new city, these kind of meal options are often high in fat and calories, and more importantly, they may cheat you out of experiencing the local culture. Wherever you decide to eat, focus on meals that incorporate healthy components, like fresh vegetables and lean proteins.Stock your hotel room with bottled water, fresh fruit and healthy snacks like granola bars or fiber cookies. Doing so helps remove the temptation to raid the room's mini bar, and can be indispensable for staving off hunger between business meetings or tourist activities.</p>

			<h3>To drink or not to drink?</h3>
			<p class="date-of-posting"></p>

			<img class="blog-post-image" src="../../assets/images/posts/hacks/15.jpg">

<h4>Water is essential</h4>
<p>Nothing ruins a good trip like getting sick -- and we're not talking about a few extra bathroom stops. Contaminated drinking water is one of the leading sources of health problems for travelers, and can cause anything from mild gastrointestinal distress to serious bacterial diseases.
The most common cause of water-borne illness is bacteria, such as E. coli, cholera and salmonella, but illness can also be caused by protozoa (including giardia and cryptosporidium), viruses (like hepatitis A, polio and rotavirus) and chemical pollutants.
In many cases, travelers become ill simply because the pathogens in the water are foreign to their immune systems, while locals have adapted to the water supply and can drink it without problems.
The best way to protect yourself is to avoid local tap water and instead seek out bottled water; when that's not available, boiling tap water generally kills most micro-organisms, and there are a number of good water filters and purification tablets that can easily be stowed in your carry-on. Read on for tips on how to keep yourself safe, healthy and well-hydrated on your next trip.</p>
<h5>Know the Risks</h5>
<p>Mexico is well known for its unsafe water (Montezuma's revenge, anyone?), but travelers also face high risk in Central America, most of Africa and Asia, and the Middle East. Drinking water is generally safest in developed areas of the world like the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Northern and Western Europe, many parts of the Caribbean, and Japan.
Keep in mind that water quality may vary depending on where you are in a particular country. For example, in Costa Rica you'll probably find safe tap water at a major city hotel, but you may have to boil water before drinking it if you're staying in a small rural village. If you're not sure, consult a reliable guidebook or do some Internet research before you leave.
So-called developed countries aren't necessarily risk-free; cryptosporidium outbreaks have appeared in the U.S. Midwest and Northwest, as well as in highly populated cities in Australia. Giardia has been found in the water supply in St. Petersburg, Russia. Check the Centers for Disease Control's website to see region-specific health info.
Some cities may advertise their drinking water as being chlorinated, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the water is contaminant-free. Your best approach when faced with potentially unsafe drinking water is avoidance.</p>
<h5>What (Not) to Drink</h5>
<p>Bottled water is generally safe, but only in sealed, tamper-proof containers. Ask someone at your hotel to recommend a reliable local brand.
In addition to bottled water, you'll usually be safe drinking tea, coffee, canned soda and juice, beer, wine, and other alcoholic drinks.
Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures will kill many parasites. Drinking from a hot water bottle is slightly safer than drinking untreated cold water.
You don't need to drink contaminated water to be exposed; always consider alternate sources of exposure, like the water you use to brush your teeth, or to wash your contact lenses or dentures. Be sure to use bottled, boiled or purified water for these purposes as well.
Freezing water does not kill bacteria. A margarita on the rocks may sound appealing, but ice cubes present the same problem that tap water does. You can make your own ice if you boil the water first.</p>
